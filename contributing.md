# Contributing

Contributions are most welcome in any form, especially if you have coded up an awesome theme you'd like to share with the rest of anyone who uses this. If you would like to contribute, just follow these simple steps:

1. Fork the repo
2. Make some commits with your changes
3. Make sure the commits are clean, clear, and organized
4. Write a test for the changes you've made
5. Send a pull request
6. ???
7. Profit!

To run the tests, just run `mocha` locally. The test file is pretty straightforward, but if anything is confusing happy to clarify or add it in here.

### Issues and Bugs

If you have found an issue with machete, please let me know! Make sure you include specific details on exactly how the issue can be replicated. If I can't replicate the issue, I can't fix it.

Also keep in mind that this is open source software - while I'll try to fix any issues as quickly as I can, I am busy and sometimes things take a bit. If you are impatient please fork and submit a pull request to fix it yourself!

### Feature Requests

If there's a feature you'd like to be added to machete, I'd be happy to hear it. Please be clear and concise in your description, and as mentioned above, feel free to fork the repo and take a stab at the initial implementation.
